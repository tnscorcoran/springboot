To run this in Openshift (substitute as appropriate):

oc login -u developer -p developer --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true 
oc new-project springboot
oc new-app openshift/redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.3~https://github.com/tnscorcoran/springboot.git
oc expose service springboot

Now, once the build and deployment are done, itâ€™s available to test:
curl <route>/flights/intl/flights
in my case:
curl http://springboot-springboot.apps.1.1.1.1.nip.io/flights/intl/flights
